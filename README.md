# Classifier_PCa

This repository contains the scripts used for the development of two classifiers based on Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) from patients with indolent and aggressive prostate cancer, and healthy samples from pubically available data. One classifier (ML-PRS_ALIVEvsDEAD.R) is used to discriminate indolent from aggressive prostate cancer based on a derived PRS from a selection of SNPs called by comparing samples from patients with indolent and aggressive prostate cancer. The same selection of SNPs was used to build a second classifier (ML-PRS_HealthyvsCancer) to discriminate between healthy and prostate cancer conditions. A different classifier, with very low specificity was built to differentiate indolent from aggressive prostate cancer based on PSA and Gleason score (ML-PSA-Gleason.R). All relevant details will be available upon publication.
